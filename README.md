# Customer-Behavior-Analysis-and-Segmentation
This project utilizes SQL analytical functions to analyze customer behavior and segment customers based on their purchasing patterns. The project involves exploring a large retail dataset and extracting key insights to inform business decisions. After thorough analysis, the project implements a Monetary model to segment customers into distinct groups based on their Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values. The project also aims to answer additional questions related to customer behavior, such as identifying the longest streak of consecutive days a customer made purchases and calculating the average number of days or transactions it takes for a customer to reach a specific spending threshold.
